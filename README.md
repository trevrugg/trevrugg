## 📜 About Me
I'm a graduating Mathematics and Computational Finance & Risk Management student at the University of Washington with aspirations of a career in quantitative finance, actuarial science, and data analytics. When I'm not constructing proofs or coding, I serve as a three-year captain of the Washington Men's Gymnastics Team, a self-funded program that competes on the national level.

## 🚩 Key Projects
Take a look at some of my favorite projects:

### Exploring Dynamic Airfare Repricing Algorithms for Revenue Generation (https://github.com/trevrugg/airfare_simulation)
This project simulates airline ticket pricing dynamics using a Monte Carlo framework to evaluate revenue optimization strategies across multiple fare buckets. It models customer demand with exponential sensitivity to price and time-to-departure, and implements dynamic repricing logic based on observed booking pressure.

Key features include:

- Time-dependent base demand curves for each fare class

- Repricing algorithms that adjust fares in response to real-time demand vs. expected sales

- Reallocation logic between fare buckets when lower classes sell out

- Monte Carlo analysis across 1,000+ trials to evaluate pricing robustness and revenue distribution

- Visualizations of fare evolution, demand patterns, ticket sales, and revenue by class

This project combines statistical modeling, optimization logic, and real-world pricing behavior in a flexible Python simulation framework.
### Constructing a Fully-Connected Neural Network to Maximize Sharpe Ratio from Historical Technical Indicators (https://github.com/trevrugg/amath_482/tree/main/AMATH482Homework5)
This report discusses the development and implementation of a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCN) to
optimize portfolio weights for a selected basket of 20 stocks, aiming to maximize the Sharpe ratio on a test
dataset. The project combines the principles of portfolio optimization with machine learning techniques,
leveraging advanced loss functions to achieve the objective. Key insights are drawn from computational
experiments, where adjustments in hyperparameters—such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs—were
critical in stabilizing the training process and enhancing the model’s generalization performance.
