## 📜 About Me
I'm a graduating Mathematics and Computational Finance & Risk Management student at the University of Washington with aspirations of a career in quantitative finance, actuarial science, and data analytics. When I'm not constructing proofs or coding, I serve as a three-year captain of the Washington Men's Gymnastics Team, a self-funded program that competes on the national level.

## 🚩 Key Projects
Take a look at some of my favorite projects:

### Constructing a Fully-Connected Neural Network to Maximize Sharpe Ratio from Historical Technical Indicators (https://github.com/trevrugg/amath_482/tree/main/AMATH482Homework5)
This report discusses the development and implementation of a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCN) to
optimize portfolio weights for a selected basket of 20 stocks, aiming to maximize the Sharpe ratio on a test
dataset. The project combines the principles of portfolio optimization with machine learning techniques,
leveraging advanced loss functions to achieve the objective. Key insights are drawn from computational
experiments, where adjustments in hyperparameters—such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs—were
critical in stabilizing the training process and enhancing the model’s generalization performance.
