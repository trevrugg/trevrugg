## üìú About Me
I'm a recent graduate from the University of Washington with a B.S. in Mathematics and Computational Finance & Risk Management. I have aspirations of a career in pricing analytics, quantitative finance, actuarial science, and data analytics. My time in school was largely spent constructing proofs, coding, and serving as a three-year captain of the Washington Men's Gymnastics Team, a self-funded program that competes on the national level.

## üö© Key Projects
Take a look at some of my favorite projects:

### Exploring Dynamic Airfare Repricing Algorithms for Revenue Generation (https://github.com/trevrugg/airfare_simulation)
This project simulates airline ticket pricing dynamics using a Monte Carlo framework to evaluate revenue optimization strategies across multiple fare buckets. It models customer demand with exponential sensitivity to price and time-to-departure, and implements dynamic repricing logic based on observed booking pressure.

Key features include:

- Time-dependent base demand curves for each fare class

- Repricing algorithms that adjust fares in response to real-time demand vs. expected sales

- Reallocation logic between fare buckets when lower classes sell out

- Monte Carlo analysis across 1,000+ trials to evaluate pricing robustness and revenue distribution

- Visualizations of fare evolution, demand patterns, ticket sales, and revenue by class

This project combines statistical modeling, optimization logic, and real-world pricing behavior in a flexible Python simulation framework.

### Constructing a Fully-Connected Neural Network to Maximize Sharpe Ratio from Historical Technical Indicators (https://github.com/trevrugg/amath_482/tree/main/AMATH482Homework5)
This report discusses the development and implementation of a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCN) to
optimize portfolio weights for a selected basket of 20 stocks, aiming to maximize the Sharpe ratio on a test
dataset. The project combines the principles of portfolio optimization with machine learning techniques,
leveraging advanced loss functions to achieve the objective. Key insights are drawn from computational
experiments, where adjustments in hyperparameters‚Äîsuch as learning rate, batch size, and epochs‚Äîwere
critical in stabilizing the training process and enhancing the model‚Äôs generalization performance.

### Studying Computational Efficiency of FFT's in Numerical Solutions of PDE's (https://github.com/trevrugg/amath_481/tree/main/AMATH481Homework5)
This project explores the use of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT's) in derivative calculations in Python. Through solving time-evolving Vorticity Streamfunction PDE's, we examine how derivative identities in the frequency space, coupled with extremely efficient FFT and IFFT functions in Python, allow us to solve complex systems of partial differential equations while limiting execution time. Through our findings, we're able to study how complex initial vorticies evolve over time as governed by the system of PDE's.
